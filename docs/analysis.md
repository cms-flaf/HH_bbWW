# Running the analysis

The pipeline — anaTuples, observables, histograms, plots — is the **standard FLAF chain**; follow
the **[FLAF full-workflow walkthrough](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/workflow/walkthrough/)** for
the commands. This page collects what is **specific to HH→bb̄WW**.

```sh
ERA=Run3_2022
VER=dev

law run FLAF.Analysis.tasks.HistPlotTask --period $ERA --version $VER --workflow local --test 1000
```

## The b-tag-shape cache runs first

HH→bb̄WW computes **b-tag shape** weights in a dedicated caching stage,
`AnalysisCacheTask` (aggregated by `AnalysisCacheAggregationTask`), which LAW runs automatically
before histogramming — see
[FLAF → Task reference](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/reference/tasks/#analysiscachetask).

!!! warning "Budget time for the cache on a cold start"
    On a cold cache `AnalysisCacheTask` is **slow** (roughly an hour per branch), even for simple
    variables. When iterating, reuse an existing cache instead of recomputing it, using a
    [per-task version override](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/workflow/arguments/#per-task-version-overrides),
    e.g. `--AnalysisCacheTask-version <existing> --AnalysisCacheAggregationTask-version <existing>`.

## Mass reconstruction: DeepHME

The HH mass is reconstructed with **DeepHME** (the bb̄WW counterpart to SVfit in bb̄ττ). It is part
of the observable computation and requires no special command — it runs as part of the standard
producer chain.

## Resonant mass grid

The bb̄WW signal is `GluGluTo{Radion,BulkGraviton}` at 40 mass points from 250 GeV to 5 TeV in each
of `Run3_2022` through `Run3_2023BPix`, with the single-lepton (`2B2JLNu`) and dilepton (`2B2L2Nu`)
final states as separate datasets. In 2023 and 2023BPix the whole grid comes from the custom
production (DSProd, read from private storage with `fs_nanoAOD:` + `dirName:`); in 2022 and 2022EE
18 points per final state do and the other 22 are central `Run3Summer22` datasets. Which signal a
run sees is the [physics model](setup.md#production-model), one per spin.

Two networks consume that grid, and they do not cover the same part of it:

- the **dilepton DNN** is parametric — one model per fold, evaluated at whatever masses
  `DNN.columns` in `config/global.yaml` asks for. It is configured over the produced points up to
  1.5 TeV, and the datacard `param_values` in `config/Datacards/x_hh_bbww_{DL,SL}_run3.yaml` follow
  the same 25 points. The four lowest of them, 250 to 280 GeV, are below the lowest
  `signal_mass_points` of the models currently in `config/DNN/DoubleLepton_Parametric_*_v1`, so
  those scores extrapolate and stay provisional until the network is retrained over this grid.
- the **single-lepton two-stage DNN** carries one trained model per mass point in
  `config/DNN/SingleLepton_IndependentMasses/`, so its grid, and the `masspoints:` list of SL signal
  regions built from its scores, stay at the ten points those models were trained for until
  retrained ones exist.

Every mass point named in a `variables:` list also needs its binning in `config/plot/histograms.yaml`
— a variable with no matching entry there stops `HistProducerFromNTuple` with a `KeyError`.

## Categories

HH→bb̄WW is analysed in **resolved** and **boosted** categories (low- and high-p_T HH topologies).
Category and channel selection is driven by `config/global.yaml`; narrow or extend it there or via
your [`user_custom.yaml`](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/configuration/user-custom/).

## Choosing which variables to histogram

As for any FLAF analysis, the variable set is controlled by the `variables:` list in
`user_custom.yaml` (or `--variables`). A short list keeps test runs fast:

```yaml
variables:
  - lep1_pt
  - ggF_DNN_HH
```
