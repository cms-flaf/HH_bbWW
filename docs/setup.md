# Setup

HH→bb̄WW is installed and run like any FLAF analysis. The general procedure — prerequisites (CERN
account, CVMFS, grid certificate, SSH keys) and what the first `source env.sh` builds — is in the
**[FLAF installation guide](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/getting-started/installation/)**. This
page lists the HH→bb̄WW specifics.

## Clone (with git LFS)

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:cms-flaf/HH_bbWW.git
cd HH_bbWW
git lfs pull
source env.sh
```

!!! danger "Two easy-to-miss steps"
    - `--recursive` — pulls the submodules (without it, imports fail on empty directories).
    - `git lfs pull` — fetches the large files HH→bb̄WW tracks with git LFS. Skipping it leaves
      pointer placeholders instead of real files.

    To run a specific central production, clone its tag, e.g. `git clone -b <version> --recursive …`.

## Analysis-specific submodules

| Submodule | Role |
|---|---|
| `DeepHME` | Neural reconstruction of the HH mass for bb̄WW. |
| `SyncTool` | Synchronisation/validation tooling. |
| `StatInference`, `inference` | Datacards and combine-based limits/fits (shared). |

These build automatically as part of `source env.sh`; you do not set them up by hand.

## Production model

The production [physics model](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/configuration/processes-and-models/)
for HH→bb̄WW is `Run3_Model` (set in `config/global.yaml`). For fast local tests, use `TestModel`
in your [`user_custom.yaml`](https://cms-flaf.github.io/FLAF/configuration/user-custom/) instead.
