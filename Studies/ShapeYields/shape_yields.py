"""Report the per-bin yields of the rebinned shapes that combine is fitting.

Reads the output of the `preprocess:` step declared in the datacard configuration --
StatInference/bin_opt_2d/rebin_2d.py for HH->bbWW -- which is the same thing
CreateDatacardsTask reads as its input. That layout is "<era>/<variable>/<variable>.root"
with the histograms at "<channel>/<category>/<process>", one file per sub-era per mass.

Nominal shapes only: every histogram whose name is a bare process name, with the
Up/Down variations left alone.

Two products, from one pass over the files:

  yields.csv   one row per (era, mass, channel, category, bin, process): the bin's
               content, its MC-statistical error, and the bin's HME edges.
  yields.pdf   the same numbers as annotated tables, one page per
               (era, mass, channel, base category), four DNN slices to a page.

This measures the shapes and nothing else. It applies no thresholds and makes no
judgement about which bins are acceptable -- the numbers are the report.

Usage:
    python3 Studies/ShapeYields/shape_yields.py \\
        --input /eos/user/d/daebi/HH_bbWW/uncv2/Hists_preprocessed/Run3_Early \\
